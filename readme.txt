== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it work for WordPress admin? =

Yes, Blinds works at the WordPress admin dashboard.

= My links appear to be the same color with the dark mode. Why is that? =

We try as much as possible to not modify most of the properties of your theme. Some of these properties include the color of your links. This means that if your theme's links color is dark, it may not be too contrasting with the dark mode.
